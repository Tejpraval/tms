🚀 Governance Control Plane
Multi-Tenant Policy Lifecycle & Approval Engine (RBAC + ABAC)

A production-grade SaaS Governance Platform that simulates, evaluates, approves, executes, and rolls back policy changes across tenants with strict state machine enforcement and zero-trust route protection.

🧠 What This Is

A full-stack Governance Control Plane designed to:

Simulate RBAC & ABAC policy changes before activation

Quantify risk impact and blast radius

Enforce structured approval workflows

Execute policies atomically with rollback support

Provide real-time governance visibility

This is not a CRUD app.
It is a lifecycle-driven policy orchestration engine.

🏗 Architecture Overview
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
        ↓
Backend (Node.js + Express)
        ↓
MongoDB (Strictly Normalized Domain Models)
Core Domain Models

Policy

PolicyVersion

PolicyApproval

User

Role

All governance analytics are derived from persisted lifecycle state — no shadow collections.

🔐 Security Model

Hybrid Authorization Architecture:

Static RBAC Matrix

Dynamic Tenant Custom Roles

Permission-based route protection

Zero-trust API enforcement

JWT Authentication

Tenant-level isolation at query layer

Strict state transition validation

Every policy mutation must pass:

DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED → EXECUTED

Rollback only allowed from ACTIVE.

Illegal transitions return structured 400 responses.

🔁 Policy Lifecycle Engine
1️⃣ Draft Creation

New policy version created as draft

2️⃣ Simulation

RBAC + ABAC diff engine

Risk scoring (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL)

Blast radius calculation

Human-readable explanation engine

Generates immutable simulationId

3️⃣ Approval

Risk-based authority enforcement:

MEDIUM → MANAGER

HIGH → ADMIN

CRITICAL → SUPER_ADMIN

Average approval time tracked

4️⃣ Execution

Atomic MongoDB transaction

Previous versions deprecated

New version activated

Cache invalidation

Approval marked executed

5️⃣ Rollback

Creates new version

Reverts state deterministically

📊 Governance Dashboard

Executive SaaS-style overview layer:

Total Policies

Active Policies

Pending Approvals

Rollbacks (30-day window)

Risk distribution visualization

Approval performance metrics

Recent governance activity feed

All derived from normalized domain state.

Idempotent execution

Multi-tenant isolation

Additive-only evolution

No hidden side effects

Deterministic lifecycle orchestration

🚀 Running Locally
Backend

📈 Scalability Considerations

Designed for:

Cross-tenant governance analytics

Canary releases

Progressive rollouts

Audit streaming

SaaS billing integration (future-ready)

Observability expansion

🎯 Resume Highlights

Hybrid RBAC + ABAC simulation engine

Risk-based approval authority enforcement

Atomic lifecycle execution with rollback

Multi-tenant secure architecture

Strict policy state machine validation

Executive analytics aggregation layer

📌 Why This Matters

Governance systems fail when:

State transitions are implicit

Authorization is role-name based

Policy changes lack simulation

Rollbacks are destructive

This system prevents that.

It treats governance as an engineered lifecycle.
